## The project
Bikair is a project developed by students from the 4th Generation EAGLE graduate program. It focuses on testing low-cost Arduino-based sensors in an urban environment such as the city of WÃ¼rzburg. Eventually, the project aims to correlate in-situ data with relevant Remote Sensing-based parameters. It takes advantage of the recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), which allows the collection of data on specific locations and its further transportation using wireless network protocols. Bikair team designed static and mobile devices using sensors that measure environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, UV radiation, particulate matter (PM1, PM 2.5, PM 10), and soil moisture. These measurements could strengthen a wide range of applications such as monitoring the relationship between urban green and temperature, identifying air pollution hotspots, or supporting the downscaling of satellite remote sensing products.
